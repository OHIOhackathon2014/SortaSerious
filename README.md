Finalized idea: Chrome Extension that watches for how long user has been on a site. If user has been at one domain for a set amount of time, screen is blocked by an exercise and a number of reps or duration to perform it. The user either clicks I have completed this, or I have tried and could not complete this. If The user completes it, they progress in that workout. If they fail, they are set back a number of reps, to give them a better chance at completing it next time. The user will have a number of workouts to choose from, and completing a certain number of reps of that workout will unlock a new variation of the workout. This encourages users to get in shape while spending hours on the internet. It also utilizes Pavel Tsatsouline's Grease The Groove workout methodology.
